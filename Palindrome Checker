Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.



def pal_check(word):
  word = word.replace(" ", "").lower()
  new_dict = {}
  for letter in word:
    new_dict.update({letter : word.count(letter)})
  
  odd_count = 0
  
  for item in new_dict.values():
    if item % 2 != 0:
      odd_count += 1
      
  if odd_count > 1:
    print "not a palindrome"
   
    
  else:
    print "palindrome"
   
    
    

pal_check('Al lets Della call Ed Stella')
